#### 1.) To run this in your n8n download the json.
#### 2.) Open n8n, create a new workflow.
#### 3.) Click on triple dots -> Import from file.

### If you want to add the following :-
- Add Drive integration where as soon as a new file is created in a specified folder it automatically starts the validation process
- Add gmail integration where as soon as you receive an invoice via mail it is automatically uploaded to google drive.
- Add whatsapp integration where as soon as you receive an invoice via mail it is automatically uploaded to google drive.
